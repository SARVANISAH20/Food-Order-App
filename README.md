# Food-Order-App
Eager to learn frontend development, I built a food ordering app using the React framework.

Building a Complete Project from the ground up.
1. Added components for displaying products, the cart(in a modal) and a checkout form(also in a modal).
2. Fetched the (dummy) meals data from the backend & show it on the screen(GET/meals).
3. Allowed users to add and remove products to/from the cart.
4. Send cart data along with the user data(full-name, email, street, postal-code, city) to the backend(POST/orders).
5. Handled loading and error states.
